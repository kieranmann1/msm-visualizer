# msm-visualizer V 2.0  
Functions to visualize results produced by integrated land-use/transport models SILO and MITO.


Open the "dashboard.Rmd" file and click on "Run Document" to open an interactive dashboard. 

Upload your result files and use the buttons on the sidebar to control the content and style of the visualization. 

(Not anymore) Currently, if you are changing the case study (e.g. Munich, Kagawa, etc.), you need to modify the code of the file dashboard.Rmd, line 18, variable default_implementation.

There are examples of input files in this repository: the folders examples/CASE_STUDY/ contain two files that are required to visualize the results of SILO. They are called resultFile.csv and resultFileSpatial.csv. 

You can also compare results of multiple scenarios by checking the "Compare scenarios" and uploading results of the comparison scenario.
