# msm-visualizer
Functions to visualize results produced by integrated land-use/transport models SILO and MITO. These have been organized into siloVisualizer and mitoVisualizer respectively. 

For each visualizer, open its respective ".Rmd" file and click on "Run Document". This will open an interactive dashboard for you where you can upload your model result files and use the buttons on the sidebar to control the content and style of the visualization. 

You can also compare results from multiple scenarios by checking the "Compare scenarios" and uploading results from the comparison scenario.
